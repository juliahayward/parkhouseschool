<div class="bodytext" align="left" style="margin: 10px;">
    <p>The pupils at Park House School:
    <ul>
        <li>Have social interaction and communication difficulties to a degree that 
        requires them to have a Statement of Special Educational Need maintained by a 
        Local Educational Authority</li>
        <li>Are aged between four and sixteen years. </li>
        <li>Are considered able to benefit from the special educational provision 
        offered.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our aim at Park House School is to meet the needs of those children most severely 
    affected by social interaction and communication difficulties (such as those found in 
    children with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder.)</p>

    <p>Prior to and following admission, visits by the Local Authority are welcomed. We 
    invite the whole family to look around Park House School. We also advise parents to 
    look carefully at all the schools available to them in order that they establish the 
    one which best meets their child’s needs.</p>

    <p>As it is our intention to fulfil the educational and welfare needs of all our 
    children, reports are requested from the Local Educational Authority, particularly 
    those that have contributed to the most recent statement and/or review. Parents should 
    ensure that recent copies of reports from concerned professionals (such as the child’s 
    paediatrician, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, educational and 
    clinical psychologists) are available so that the staff at Park House School can define 
    how they would meet the needs stated in such reports. Discussions would also take place 
    with the school or nursery that the child currently attends and someone from Park House 
    School may observe them in their current educational setting.</p>

    <p>Once admitted to Park House School a child will only be excluded under exceptional 
    circumstances and following exhaustive consultation with all concerned parties.</p>
