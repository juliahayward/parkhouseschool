    <b>Medical and Pastoral Care</b>
</div>
<p>Pupils remain registered with their own GP, optician and dentist.  Park House School 
is able to provide Medical/Therapy Services as determined by the child’s Statement of 
Special Educational Needs or by assessed need. These include Occupational Therapy, Speech 
and Language Therapy, and Clinical Psychology.</p>

<p>The Head Teacher takes responsibility for the welfare of the children and she will take 
any necessary action, contacting parents and other agencies as appropriate. It may be 
helpful for parents to know that the law and the LEA require Head Teachers to report any 
obvious, or suspected, child abuse, <b>whatever their views of the likelihood of abuse</b>.  
This procedure is intended to protect children and if there are any suspicions it is better 
to be safe than sorry. This does mean that the Head Teacher risks upsetting some parents 
by reporting a case that after investigation is proved to be unfounded. It is hoped that 
parents understand how difficult it is for the Head Teacher to carry out this task and 
that he acts only in order to protect the best interests of the child.</p>

    <b>Behaviour in School</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have clear policies about behaviour, including bullying. We manage aggressive 
behaviour in a positive but non-threatening way. Where a child’s behaviour is a danger to 
themselves or to others, staff will, if necessary, hold the child.  Positive handling is 
designed to be calming and to help the child to feel safe and regain control. A Clinical 
Psychologist provides regular input to the school to help children with their behaviour.  
All staff receive regular training in holding and our policy about Positive Handling is 
available on request.</p>

<p>If problems continue parents are asked to come into school to talk with us. We feel 
strongly that it is by working together with families that we shall achieve the best 
outcomes for the child.</p>

<P>In order to promote good behaviour amongst pupils a flexible and individualised reward 
system is applied. When behavioural issues arise careful analysis of the circumstances 
takes place and, following detailed discussions, adjustments are made to eliminate the 
undesired behaviour.  The discussions which take place involve not only the professional 
team at Park House School, but also, when and where necessary, the parents/carers of the 
pupil/s concerned.</p>
