    <b>Our Aims and Approach</b>
</div>
<div class="bodytext" align="left" style="margin: 10px;">
    <p>Park House School is a Registered Independent Specialist Day School for children 
    who have special educational needs related to their social interaction and communication 
    difficulties and who may, additionally, have specific learning difficulties.</p>

    <p>The school, established in 2004, at the moment caters for ten pupils, boys and 
    girls, between four and sixteen years of age.</p>

    <p>We aim to provide a warm, caring, and structured environment in which each child:
    <ul>
        <li>Feels safe and secure</li>
        <li>Is treated as an individual</li>
        <li>Develops their skills to the fullest potential</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The integrated child-centred approach used is highly individualised and comprises 
    the following key features:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure</b> – a learning environment which has well-defined routines and 
        expectations. Extensive use is made of personal timetables and visual clarification 
        through object, sign, or symbol</li>
        <li><b>Positive Intervention</b> – a positive and active teaching style which 
        involves a calm, sensitive but persistent intervention with high expectations</li>
        <li><b>Individual Teaching</b> – regular and frequent periods of individual 
        teaching for each pupil alongside opportunities for group and independent work</li>
        <li><b>Emphasis on Communication, Interaction and Daily Living Skills</b> – through 
        all parts of the school day and areas of the curriculum</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Additionally, the children have substantial access to a Speech and Language 
    Therapist, Clinical Psychologist and a paediatric Occupational Therapist (all of 
    whom have extensive knowledge and experience of working with children on the Autistic 
    Spectrum).  These professionals support staff in implementing a Sleeping Dragons 
    programme (a multi-disciplinary program designed to provide assessment, intervention 
    and support for families with children on the autistic spectrum), TEACCH, Intensive 
    Interaction, PECS, ABA, and Sensory Integration methods as appropriate to the 
    individual child.</p>
