<p>Parents are encouraged to visit the school at any time to discuss the progress of 
their children. Please ring or contact the Head Teacher for an appointment.  
Appointments to see other members of staff can be made in the same way.</p>

<p>Additionally, parents are made welcome at our half termly Individual Education Plan 
meetings and, of course, at their child’s annual review.</p>

<p>To further foster home-school liaison, and to encourage the learning partnership 
necessary for each child to achieve their maximum potential, fortnightly home based 
parent/carer/key worker consultation meetings take place.</p>
