<p>Uniform is not compulsory but children are encouraged to wear sensible clothes that 
are easy to take off and put on (so that children can learn to dress and undress 
themselves) and which wash well! School polo shirts with the school logo are available 
to purchase.  A suitable change of clothing is necessary for when the children 
take part in strenuous outside play activities.</p>
