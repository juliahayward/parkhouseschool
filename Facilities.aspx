    <p>The facilities at Park House School include a number of teaching rooms, usually 
    screened to provide 1:1 distraction free areas for individual work. All teaching 
    rooms have ICT facilities for the children to use. Each child has their own ‘base’, 
    often shared with another child, within which their individual academic work is 
    carried out. The children have a considerable voice in the layout of their base.</p>

    <p>There is also a well equipped kitchen where children learn a variety of self-help 
    skills such as food preparation and cooking.</p>

    <p>There is a large Activity Room with soft play equipment, one corner of which 
    may be used as a quiet space which the children access under adult supervision.</p>

    <p>Outside there is a Play Area designed to promote development of the children’s 
    gross motor and play skills; the local park’s play area is also used regularly as 
    is the Park itself for a variety of activities.</p>
