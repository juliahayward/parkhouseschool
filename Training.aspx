    <b>Training</b>
</div>

<p>All staff in school take part in regular and planned training. 
At the start of employment the staff begin an induction program to enable them to become 
familiar with the school policies and procedures. Some training is done in 
school by members of our own staff and some by external training providers. At least 5 days 
each year are set aside, outside of term time, for our in-house training to take place.
All staff receive mandatory training in Child Protection, first aid, fire safety &amp; moving 
and handling. Thereafter training is given according to job function and development 
requirements to meet future roles. Each member of staff has their own training plan.</p>

<p>When appropriate training opportunities will be offered to parents/carers to enable an 
increased awareness of methods and approaches used at Park House School. This allows 
parents/carers to encourage and reinforce their children’s progress in the home 
environment.</p>

<p>All members of staff are fully conversant with the Child Protection and Complaints 
Procedure.  We have an active approach to bullying and unacceptable behaviour. We are 
committed to an Equal Opportunities Policy running within the school, adhere to Health 
and Safety Regulations and have detailed Curriculum and Policy Statements.  Further 
details of these are available on request.</p>
