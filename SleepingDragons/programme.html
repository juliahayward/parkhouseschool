<div class="bodytext" align="center">
<P>The programme consists of three major strands:

<h3>The Meeting</h3>
<div align="left">	
<P>The core members at the meeting are: 
<ul><li>Parents</li>
<li>Speech and Language Therapist</li> 
<li>Clinical Psychologist</li>
<li>Representative from the child’s playgroup, and/or</li> 
<li>A school worker</li></ul> 
<P>Meetings have also included the Dietician, the Occupational Therapist
and the Community Nurse for Children with Learning Disabilities.
The child only attends when they need to be seen for reassessment.

<P><i>Agenda:</i> At the meeting, discussion centres around the success or otherwise of 
recommendations and ideas that the parents have implemented.  The things that worked 
and things that did not are discussed in some detail, in order to get a better 
understanding of the child and of strategies that may be successful.  An important 
focus of the discussion centres on areas that the parents want to work 
on and particular difficulties that they are having at the present time.
Either the Speech and Language Therapist or the Psychologist generally guides the 
discussion; however, it tends to be informal with people throwing in suggestions 
and ideas whenever they can.  Approximately 45 minutes of group discussion is 
allowed for, after which new action plans and summary sheets are prepared.  
These are hand-written and provide details of the goals to be achieved in the 
subsequent 8 week period and the methods that parents can use to achieve this.  
At the end of this time the group reconvenes, we talk through the action plans, 
and set a date for the next meeting.

<P><i>Follow-up:</i> The parents keep a copy of the action plans in the Sleeping 
Dragons folder. Copies of these action plans and summary sheets which form part of 
the parent’s Sleeping Dragons folder are stored for reference in the child’s CDU file 
and given to all participants. The summary sheet contains details of the current goals 
so that everyone is aware of the child’s aims and progress.
The family’s Portage worker, a Community Nurse for Children with Learning Disabilities 
or someone else who visits regularly, supports parents on a weekly or fortnightly basis 
in between meetings. Parents are also offered telephone contact for when they need 
advice quickly during the time the children are on the Sleeping Dragons Programme.

<h3>The Sleeping Dragons Folders</h3>
<div align="left">
<P>Each folder contains: 
<UL><li>A front page introducing the Sleeping Dragons Programme  
<li>A sheet with the names and contact numbers of the people involved in the child’s 
core team, together with a space for the times and dates of the meetings. 
<li>A number of daily record sheets which parents can complete if they wish regarding 
the success or otherwise of the programmes. 
<li>Summary sheets on which the current goals for a child are noted down in the 6 
key areas of development
<li>Sheets to include practice items which are skills the child has achieved but will 
need to continue to practise 
<li>A section for old action plans
<li>Action plans for each of the developmental areas being worked on.
</ul>

<i>Action plan sheets:</i>
The action plan sheets are made up of:
<OL>
<li>A long-term goal (this may be a goal which will take several years to achieve).  
<li>Aim of activities (this is the aim that the child is hoped to achieve before the 
next meeting in 2 months time). 
<li>The child’s current level of performance of that particular skill 
<li>Activities that a parent can use to help the child to develop the skill.  
</ol>
At each meeting the old action plans are taken out from the folder and kept for future 
reference. They therefore form an ongoing record of the child's development.
New ones are put in as appropriate.  In addition a new summary sheet is added.
</div>

<h3>Goal setting and strategies</h3>
<div align="left">
<P>The developmental areas that are focussed on are:
<ul><li>Developmental Block/Behaviour
<li>Sensory Integration
<li>Cognitive
<li>Socialisation
<li>Communication
<li>Play
<li>Self-help
</ul>
The goals set for the child in each of the different areas are developmentally 
appropriate.  The ideas and the suggestions made are taken from a variety of methods 
found to be effective with children who have communication difficulties, for example 
the Hannen Approach, PECS, Applied Behaviour Analysis, and TEACCH.
