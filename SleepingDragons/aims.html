<p>The Sleeping Dragons programme aims to:
<ul>
<li>Set developmentally appropriate goals on an individual basis for the children. 
These goals would be in the therapeutically relevant areas of socialisation, 
communication, behaviour, cognitive skills, play and self-help skills.</li>
<li>Ensure the goals are practical and realistic: i.e. that those from one meeting 
can be achieved before the subsequent meeting, typically in 2 months' time.</li>
<li>Help parents get a better understanding of what they need to achieve with their 
children, and of various methods which could help them to do this.</li>
<li>Unify the goals of the different people who may be working with each child. This 
ensures that contradictory advice is not given, and that parents are not overloaded 
with suggestions.</li>
<li>Provide a forum for monitoring and updating children’s progress on a regular 
basis.</li>
<li>Provide a multidisciplinary forum for problem solving, allowing for input from 
lots of people who knew the child.</li>
</ul>
