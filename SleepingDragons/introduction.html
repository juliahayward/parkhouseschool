<p><B>Sleeping Dragons</B> is a programme developed by the Clinical Psychologist and 
Speech and Language Therapist at Peterborough Child Development Unit (CDU), which
provides specialist help for children with communication problems. It involves a
multi-disciplinary team of experts working with the child, but critically it is a 
home-based approach
in which parents are not only fully involved at every step, they are equipped through
the programme so that as it progresses, they are able to provide the majority of 
interventions themselves.</p>
<p>The Sleeping Dragons Programme has assisted many children since April 1999.  
Most parents appear to find the programme useful and their children have developed 
skills in all the areas targeted.  There has also been excellent attendance at the 
Sleeping Dragons meetings both from parents and from other people involved in working 
with the child.</p>
<p>The programme is currently limited to eight children at any one time.  Participating 
children 
join the programme between the ages of 2 1/2 and 4 years, or when they begin nursery 
school.  In addition to communication problems, the majority have an autistic spectrum 
disorder. However, the programme has also been designed to be used with children who 
have learning difficulties as well as communication problems. Meetings involving 
parents, the children and specialists are held every 8 weeks; these form the core of the
programme and so it is very important that families are able to attend.</p>
