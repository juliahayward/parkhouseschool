<div class="bodytext" align="center">
<P>Following a recent review of the <B>Sleeping Dragons</B> programme three 
developments have been proposed:
<ul>
<li>Parents have said that they would like more information about the Sleeping Dragons 
Programme during the Child Development Unit assessment.  A handout has therefore been 
prepared which explains the aims and the process of the programme and includes a space 
for the date of the first Sleeping Dragons meeting and contact numbers of the Speech 
and Language Therapist and Clinical Psychologist involved, so that the parents can take 
away this information with them.
<li>In an attempt to overcome the difficulties that some parents have with translating 
words into action one of the core team now visit the family at home in the week 
following the meeting in order to work with the child and to demonstrate how the 
action plans can be implemented.
<li>In view of the success the Sleeping Dragons Programme has had with the pre-school 
children, we hope to extend it to cater for children up to the age of 5 years when they 
begin school.</li>
</ul>
