<P><B>Sleeping Dragons</B> is a programme developed by the Clinical Psychologist and 
Speech and Language Therapist at Peterborough Child Development Unit (CDU).  The unit 
provides an assessment and intervention service to approximately 100 pre-school children
every year.  Since 1993 the CDU has been diagnosing increasing numbers of children as 
being on the <i>Autistic Spectrum</i> and the age at which these children are being 
referred is becoming younger as Health Visitors and Pre-school staff became more aware 
of the types of problems shown by such children.</P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General practice had been that the local Speech and Language Therapists, Early Years 
Support Teachers and the Portage Home Visiting Service carried out the majority of the 
intervention work.  There was also a multi-disciplinary group run by the Speech and 
Language Therapist, the Occupational Therapist and the Physiotherapist at the Child 
Development Unit.  This was held on a weekly basis but could only cater for a limited 
number of children due to limited space and resources. It became apparent that this 
approach did not meet the needs of the children or the families.</p>
