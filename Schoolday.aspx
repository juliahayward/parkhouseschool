    <b>The School Day</b>
</div>

<p>The school day runs from 9.15am to 3.30pm.</p> 

<p>Mornings are devoted to school based activities whereas the afternoon sessions make 
use of community facilities in order to develop skills necessary for living in the community 
and inclusion with the child’s developmental and chronological peers.</p>

<p>Children with social interaction and communication difficulties usually find it much 
more difficult to learn in a group setting, therefore there is a high ratio of adults to 
children throughout the day.  Each child receives the level of adult support needed to 
ensure s/he achieves to their potential, and when off-site remains safe and supported at 
all times  A full-time key-worker is employed for each 
child on roll, but where necessary this ratio may be greater - for example when taking 
part in off-site activities.</p>

<p>Because of the children’s complex needs many of them work at Pre-National Curriculum 
level 1.  Sessions 1 to 3 during the day involve helping the children to develop the 
essential pre-learning skills of attention, interaction, communication and imitation within 
the context of the Literacy, Numeracy and Knowledge of the World areas.  Our curriculum 
is informed by the National Curriculum, P-Scales (pre-NC-level 1) and the Foundation Stage 
Curriculum, with adaptations to take into account the children’s particular difficulties.</p>

<p>Lunch and snack times are seen as an important opportunity to practice a variety of life skills, 
such as washing, changing and eating appropriately.  At the moment we do not have the 
facilities to prepare hot meals on-site, therefore children bring a packed lunch with 
them.</p>

<p>Afternoon sessions are often spent accessing off-site facilities such as swimming, 
walking, soft-play facilities, horse-riding, sailing, rowing and using the shops, to help the children 
to develop vital life and social skills. We build into these experiences the appropriate 
level of support sometimes needed by children with social interaction and communication 
disorders such as those found in children with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder.</p>

<p>It is recognised, in a small school such as Park House School, that the experience of 
mixing with other children is limited.  Opportunities are therefore built into the school 
week, particularly during afternoon sessions, to ensure that our children gain such 
experiences. </p>
