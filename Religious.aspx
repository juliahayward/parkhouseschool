    <b>Religious Education</b>
</div>

<p>Because of the nature of the children’s difficulties this is a difficult area to 
address in a meaningful way. Time is spent together every morning when aspects of a 
religious education curriculum are covered in line with a child’s level of understanding.  
Parents may ask that their child be withdrawn from these activities by writing to the 
Head Teacher.</p>
